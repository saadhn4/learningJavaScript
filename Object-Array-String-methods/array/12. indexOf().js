//indexOf()

//it reruns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array; or -1 if it is not present

let color = ["red", "blue", "black", "black", "orange"];

console.log(color.indexOf("black"));

//i have black twice here . first time black appears is on index 2 ; so 2 gets printed here
