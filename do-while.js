//loop will execute atleast once and then it will check the condition
//first ill print 0-9

// let i=0;

//   i++;
// }while(i<=9);
// // this is the syntax  

// now suppose if i put i as 10, what will happen?

//it will execute once show me the output as 10 and then stop, because 10+1 will be 11, and that is not true.
