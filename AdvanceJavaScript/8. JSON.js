//JSON

/*

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
It is easy for humans to read and write, easy for machines to parse and generate.
Widely used to transmit data between a server and a web app
or within various programming envirnoments.

Features:

1. Lightweight: It is compact and easy to parse
2. Human-Readable: Data is represented in key-value pair format.
3. Language-Independent: Though derived from JS,  it is supported by many languages.
4. Structured: JSON allows hierarchial data structures like arrays and objects.

//IMPORTANT: ALL KEYS SHOULD B ENCLOSED WITH DOUBLE QUOTES "key"

/*JSON syntax rules:

1. Data is written in key-value pairs: (KEYS IN DOUBLE QUOTES!!!!!)

{"name": "Saad", "age": 20}

2. Keys are strings enclosed in double quotes:

{"key": "value"}

3. Values can be the followfing:

-String: "Hello"
-Number: 25
-Object: {"keys":"value"} [nested object also the key needs to be enclosed in ""]
-Array: [1,2,3]
-Boolean: true/false
-Null: null

Why use JSON?

1. Interoperability: JSON is used to transfer data between server and client
2. APIs: Most modern APIs return data in JSON format
3. Lightweight: JSON is compact, making it faster to transmit
4. Ease of use: Many libraries in various programming languages make handling JSON simple
