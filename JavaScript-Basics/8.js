//When to use let and const

//In let, Reassignment is allowed ; In const, It is not allowed
//Scope in both is block-scoped
//Best use case for let - Variables that need to change
//Best use case for const- Immutable or reference values

//use 'const' by default unless u know the variable's value will change
//use 'let' if you plan to modify the variable later
